Consider the problem (P) again. If the function is
pseudoconvex in an open set containing K, then any solutions of the
problem
is a global minimum of the problem (P) and in
particular every point with zero G-derivative is a global minimum.

And standard Lagrangian formalism


We need a small lemma before we proceed:
\begin{lemma}
  Given two strictly pseudomonotone operators $T_1, T_2$ each satisfying the conditions of \Cref{thm:existence}, then the operator $[T_1, T_2]$ satisfies the conditions of \Cref{thm:existence} with $u_0 = [u_1,u_2]$ and $R=R_1+R_2$.

  ...
  This lemma probably is not true, at least not without major modifications. We need a restated version of theorem 3.6 instead, repeating the proof but using the same ingredients as here.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  Consider $[v_1,v_2] \in C_1 \times C_2$, then clearly
  \begin{equation}
    \ip{[T_1,T_2][v_1,v_2]}{u_0 - [v_1,v_2]} = \ip{T_1}{u_1 - v_1} + \ip{T_2 v_2}{u_2 - v_2} < 0
  \end{equation}
  Likewise, if
  \begin{equation}
    \ip{[T_1,T_2][v_1,v_2]}{u_0 - [v_1,v_2]} = \ip{T_1 v_1}{u_1 - v_1} + \ip{T_2 v_2}{u_2 - v_2} < 0
  \end{equation}
  then at least one term is negative. Without loss of generality , assume $v_1 \in C_1$. Necessarily $0 \leq \ip{T_2 v_2}{u_2 - v_2} < \ip{T_1 v_1}{v_1-u_1}$.
\end{proof}

\begin{proof}
  Consider:
  \begin{equation}
    \ip{[T_1,T_2][v_1,v_2]}{u_0 - [v_1,v_2]} = \ip{T_1}{u_1 - v_1} + \ip{T_2 v_2}{u_2 - v_2}
  \end{equation}
  if either
\end{proof}


Thus if we consider
\begin{equation}
  S=
  \begin{pmatrix}
    d_{\sigma_1} U_1\\
    \vdots \\
    d_{\sigma_N} U_N
  \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
and each $U_i$ is strictly pseudoconvex, and $S$ satisfies that there exists a $u$ such that $H_2$ is satisfied, then there is a unique Nash equilibrium of the game.
We can gather these considerations in the following theorem
\begin{theorem}
  Given a population game with $N$ players with payoff functions $G_i$ there exists a unique nash equilibrium if all payoff functions $G_i$ and the are strictly pseudoconcave and satisfy $H2$.
\end{theorem}
If we need to be at the interior equilibrium point of a dynamical system given by a vector field $\dot{x} = f(x)$, simultaneously, we can consider the vector $[S, f/x]$ where $/$ denotes pointwise division. Then we need to check the property for the vector $[S,f/x]$.
%We can gather the above results in the following theorem:
\begin{theorem}
  Given a population game with $N$ players with payoff functions $G_i$ and dynamics determined by $f$, then there exists a unique fixed point of the dynamics along with a unique nash equilibrium if all payoff functions $G_i$ and the p.r. capita growth rates $f_i(x)/x_i$ are pseudoconcave.
\end{theorem}


The Nash equilibrium can be determined solving the associated complementarity problem:
%Remark that $U_c$ and $U_p$ both fulfill the conditions of \Cref{thm:unique}, so the Nash equilibrium is unique. We find the Nash equilibrium as outlined in the section "Nash equilibria and variational inequalities", arriving at the conditions:
\begin{align}
  F(\sigma_c,\sigma_p,\lambda_c,\lambda_p) = \begin{pmatrix}
    \ip{\partial_{\sigma_c} U^{mon}_c - \lambda_c}{\sigma_c^{1} - \sigma_c} \\
    \ip{\partial_{\sigma_p} U^{mon}_p - \lambda_p}{\sigma_p^{1} - \sigma_p} \\
    \ip{\sigma_c - 1}{\lambda_c^{1} - \lambda_c} \\
    \ip{\sigma_p - 1}{\lambda_p^{1} - \lambda_p}
  \end{pmatrix}
  \sigma_c,\sigma_p \geq 0
  \lambda_c,\lambda_p \in \R
\end{align}
where
\begin{align}
  \partial_{\sigma_c} U^{mon}_c &= \beta_c \pa{1-\frac{\beta_c}{K\phi + K_0}\overbar{\sigma}_c C} - \frac{F_p \beta_p \overbar{\sigma}_p P}{F_p + \ip{\beta_p \overbar{\sigma}_c}{\overbar{\sigma}_p} C} \\
  \partial_{\sigma_p} U^{mon}_p &= \epsilon \frac{F_p^2 \beta_p \sigma_c C}{\pa{F_p + \ip{\beta_p \sigma_c}{\sigma_p} C} - c \beta_p \sigma_p}
\end{align}

Since we are working over a particularly nice convex set $K$, the complementarity problem and the variational inequality are actually equivalent:
%\begin{proposition}
  %The variational inequality $VI(T,K)$ is equivalent to the complementarity problem $CP(T,K)$.
%\end{proposition}
%\begin{proof}
%  Clearly, a solution to $CP$ is also a solution to $VI$. For the other direction, assume that we have a solution $x^*$ to VI. Then define $y_0=(Tx^*)^\perp \in K$ and $y_1 = 2x^* - y_0 \in K$ and consider
%  \begin{equation}
%    \ip{y_0 - x^*}{Tx^*} \geq 0
%    \ip{y_1-x^*}{Tx^*} \geq 0
%  \end{equation}
%  Since $y_0 \perp Tx^*$, the first inequality reduces to $-\ip{x^*}{Tx^*} \geq 0$, and the second inequality reduces to $\ip{x^*}{Tx^*}\geq 0$. Thus $\ip{x^*}{Tx^*}=0$, and $x^*$ solves the complementarity problem.
%\end{proof}
%Using the equality $\mu_i = - d_{\sigma_i} U_i$,

% allowing the use of the entire toolbox of variational inequalities to study properties such as uniqueness, \citep{}.
%The three theorems we need are:

%The two theorems that we need to carry us through are :
%THM: 12.13
%Theorem 12.13 ([87, Theorems 6.9, 6.10]) Let

%subset of a real Banach space B and

%H2 ) holds, namely, there exists u 0 ∈ K and R > ku 0 k such that
%hAv, v − u 0 i ≥ 0, ∀v ∈ K ∩ {v ∈ E : kvk = R}
%Then (VIP) admits solutions.

%Lemma 12.3 Let K be a nonempty subset of the real Banach space B
%and
%If T is strictly pseudomonotone, then the problem
%VI(T, K) has at most one solution.

Thus finding the Nash equilibrium of a game with payoffs $U_i$ and strategies $\sigma$ corresponds to solving the variational inequality:
\begin{equation}
  \ip{
  \begin{pmatrix}
    \nabla_{\sigma_1} U_1\\
    \vdots \\
    \nabla_{\sigma_N} U_N
\end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix}
    \sigma_1 \\
    \vdots \\
    \sigma_N
\end{pmatrix}}{\begin{pmatrix} \sigma_1 - \sigma'_1 \\ \vdots \\ \sigma_N - \sigma'_N \end{pmatrix}} \geq 0, \quad \forall y\in K
\end{equation}
over the closed convex set $K = \int \sigma_i dx= 1$.
